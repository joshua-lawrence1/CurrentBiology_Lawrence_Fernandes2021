Code and data assosciated with Lawrence JM & Fernandes PG (2021). An unexpected switch in species domiance of a recovering pelagic ecosystem. Current Biology


Code.R file contains code used to run geostatistical simulations and generate biomass and abundance estimates for herring and sprat from acoustic data.

...clupeidmeanlengths.csv contain species specific mean lenghts for each trawl, and trawl locations.

...spratsigprop.csv contain the proportion of acoustic backscatter apporationed to sprat for each trawl location.

fishdata**.csv contain the Nautical Area Scattering Coefficients (NASC) for backscatter from swimbladdered fish school in each 1km EDSU (and the location of each EDSU midpoint).

gridareas.csv contains the areas (in km^2) of each cell in the grid used for geostatistical simulations.
